# Experimental Photography Portfolio

A site that was created while playing around and implementing the locomotive-scroll library for the first time. 
This design was what I had in mind for artists such as photographers, painters, and so on. I imagine it to be bold and expressive but also minimal. 

Parcel and Locomotive-Scroll are the only dev dependencies used.

Thanks for checking it out, hope you enjoy! 🤙🏼

Inspired by Mary Lou's article, "How to Create and Animate Rotated Overlays", on Codrops; as well as Girl Culture's menu overlay.
